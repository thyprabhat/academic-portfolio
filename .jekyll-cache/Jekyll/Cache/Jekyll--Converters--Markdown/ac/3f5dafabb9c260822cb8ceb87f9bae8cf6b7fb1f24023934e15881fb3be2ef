I"Õ	<p>To be honest I never thought that I would end up doing engineering, let alone from IITB. Till now IITB has been kind to me and I have no complaints. I am in good position with decent enough qualification to stand up at least in the crowd, I may or may not live up to my resume, because I do not feel much confident. I do things to get appreciation and for dilettantism but never to satisfy the deep curiosity and zeal within myself. However, I feel this tinkling sense of curiosity and undertaking huge endeavours which is highly ambitious, but often than not the laziness wins.</p>

<p>I believe I still do not know the true value of work, since I never worked for money. I believe that I am being paid much in terms of scholarships than what I am worth of. This is because I see lots of hard-working people who are struggling to get things that I have so easily access to. This type of extra paid lifestyle could easily had made me believe that I was better than other people. And I was that kind of person for a long period of time. I look down to people who kind of did not had same position as me, I could see that now. And thatâ€™s where IITB comes into picture, it gives you the pedestal and a ladder to go to higher pedestal and there will always be some people who are at higher pedestal and some people who are at lower pedestal and every one get the equal opportunity to climb that ladder. And itâ€™s not only academics that defines how high you go â€“ its decisiveness, ability to take risks and various other factors that makes the rungs of that ladder. So, the Idea is to not look down upon the people who might had bad than you and not admire beyond belief to the people that are higher up to you. People could go up and so could I. Its humbling but also empowering. The ability to work smartly and ability to work hard will let you outgrow any difficulty that you might face. This also assert my believe that I am not at all living at my full potential.</p>

<p>We all have our inefficiencies and perfection does not exist however the constant struggle is something that is inevitable and the more it is in your control the better. I have for some time got really convinced that peace is not separate from the struggle, we are at most peaceful when we struggle. We rest best when work hardest, beside it even the rest becomes a misery.</p>

<p>This is what I have learnt till now â€“ to see that people are much deeper than what we generally perceive, and that constant work is the only peace.</p>
