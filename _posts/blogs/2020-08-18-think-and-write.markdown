Well, this topic is a little deceiving, and the real thing that I wanted to tackle here is the benefit of journaling or documenting your life. 

I think the benefit of hindsight is excellent, it saves you from disaster, and it is what we call experience. Our forecast uses the past trends, our models use existing data, and so it should be with our life as well, I got no reason to believe otherwise. Hindsight has prevented me from doing so many things, and I avoided a great deal of inconvenience. It propelled me do something that I might have regretted in future if I had not gone for it. But how does it helps - I think any action or rather its consequences have a shift in mindset. We might not even remember the activity or the effects - but the mindset remains, and then we do things based on that shifted mindset - get desirable results. It gets reinforced and become a habit. It is similar to reading a book where we might not remember the content of the books. Instead, the frame of mind that is updated reinforced or changed while reading a book. I think it is so powerful because we have all the data and all the conditions laid out in front of us - we just need to analyze it to get into a conclusion. Best time for investment is always the past. Maybe documentation is about preserving some part of that past to learn. It is a way to improve, and your competitor is your past self. And what Sun Zu said that know your competitor well and that is what documentation will help us.

But to get to this hindsight properly we need reliable data, isn't it? We need to go back and look and into accurately what was happening at that time. We could use our memory for this, but I got reliable reasons from both literature and personal experience that trusting the organic memory is not a good idea. And I think at this point journaling comes into the picture, where we precisely know what the moment signifies. It might be a reason in part why old newspapers are so valuable and stored. All the documents in the world if actively not sought to be destroyed and carelessly not left to be in the mercy of natural forces it often very well preserved and with the advent of the internet it has become highly accessible as well. Now getting into journaling or documenting your life. I am confident that the term 'journaling' means a specific part of the documentation. However, I would be using the term documentation here on for a broader context.

A few days ago I found out that the movie "A woman in Berlin" which is based on the daily writings of an anonymous German woman. She had some journalistic training and documented quite precisely what happened to her as the aftermath of WWII - I highly recommend this movie. The similar thing about the "Diary of Anne Frank" and "The Gulag Archipelago" by Anne Frank and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn respectively. None of these people thought (except Solzhenitsyn maybe) that their documentation will have such a profound effect on a cultural level. The writing or maybe recorded multimedia now can transcend time. However, my point here is that the documentation is essential.

I think there could be many kinds of documentations. I am very confident that there are already names of that. However, due to non-acquaintance with these modern terminologies and their definition, I would try to define them myself.

<strong>Log type</strong>: I see computer logs, especially error logs which are precise. It gives you only enough information that is relevant in an optimized format within the lowest possible memory consumption. But it is essential for debugging. We see so many criminal cases are solved or at least made easy only with the help of a log of let's say guest list or car parked etc. So maybe it's a good idea to log our day regularly, just so that we could come back to debug something.


<strong>Journal type</strong>: With journal type, I mean precisely stating the way things happened - like a journalist - without being biased. However, I seriously doubt that it will be possible. Still, it would be good to have a document explaining things along with the logs.


<strong>Emotional type</strong>: These are the extension of journal type. One could document their emotional response to a particular situation; this is also something to be recorded as it is.


<strong>Opinion type</strong>  This requires a projection of thought in future where one could make his/her own opinion and write what they think what should be. What is their idea and why they feel this way? It's kind of meta journaling or maybe an essay type thing. I think this will provide a  lot of clarity, especially when the emotions are on a high tide. Writing also provides a chance of reflection and articulation put things in perspective.


<strong>Dream documentation</strong>: Initially, I was very sceptical of this, but I can now say that dream bear a lot of significance of what is happening in real life. I could easily now connect the links between the things that I dream and the things I read or watch. Often the dreams seem very unrelated, but I can imagine there might be some hidden meaning behind it. I have to read more on that (maybe writings of Freud and Jung would help).


<strong>Work/Learning journal</strong> - I am making a distinction here with this. I believe it is essential to be able to go back to and reflect on your learning. It should be separate from the log and another journal to accurately see where one person is in his learning ladder.
Idea journal: This is self-explanatory. We might never get the same idea again and might lose significant because of this. It's better to keep the repository.

And now there are other kinds of journals which I found after scrapping web, but I haven't explored these properly.

Now how to write a journal? - To be honest, I haven't been able to write a journal or any document consistently for a long time. However, I have been trying for many years. The real problem is maintaining consistency and ease of journaling. Like if I am travelling, it is improbable that I have my daily diary with me. Or I might often skip a few days, that will be omitted from the documentation forever. There has to be a way to document and store your documentation correctly. And trying for the best possible thing might not be a good idea. So just getting started with half baked plan is a much better idea. Maybe grab the nearest piece of paper, notebook or diary and start writing, once it gets better ideas will automatically arrive.
