<strong>
Write out a few excuses you might be clinging to (e.g.,
not smart enough, no experience, wrong upbringing, don’t have the education, etc.). Decide to make up in hard work and personal development to out-compete anyone—including your old self.
</strong>



<ol>

<li> I got a bunch of excuses, some of which I think is still true to some degree, but a more profound sense indicates otherwise. I have to give it a try to see for myself.
<li> I often say to myself I am not good at coding, but the fact is I did start coding early - like when I was in class 6 - and fairly decent at that time.
<li> Another excuse that I give is that I am not good at extracting insights. 
<li> Another one is that I lack concentration and long sustained focus and concentration.
<li> I don’t need to take positions of responsibilities since I got no time.
<li> I need costly to the line equipment to do my work effectively.
<li> I could work always work later, and my efficiency improves when deadlines are close.
<li> I always have tomorrow. I could do it tomorrow.
<li> I could lose weight later also since I had done in the past (due to hockey).
<li> My home is not the right place to workouts.
<li> The noise is too much in my home to concentrate.
<li> Constant internet connectivity is essential for my work.
<li> I don’t have adequate internet connectivity.
<li> I live in a small town.

</ol>

<strong>
Don’t be Brad—Write down the small, seemingly inconsequential actions you can stop doing that might be compounding your results downward.
</strong>

<li> I am putting small work for the next day for doing the whole work together in one go.

<strong>
List a few areas, skills, or outcomes where you have you been most successful in the past. Consider whether you could be taking those for granted and are not continuing to improve, and are therefore in jeopardy of having that complacency lead to future failure.
</strong>

<ul>
<li> Motivating others.
<li> Web page development.
</ul>


I don’t see much to write in this. I still need to acquire many skills.


I think I will make this a running doc, where I could see and do changes accordingly. These questions are from the summary action step of the first chapter of “The compound effect” by Darren Hardy.
