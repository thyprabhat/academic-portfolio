It's decided then, whenever I couldn't figure out what to write - I will write about the books that I read.

<strong>The Last Question by Isaac Asimov:</strong> Lovely book, short read, and it is about the second law of thermodynamics. More specifically, it deals with the constant increment of Entropy in the universe. Other kinds of stuff like five dimensions and meta-bodies are also thereâ€”a fascinating read.

<strong>Born a Crime - Stories From a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah:</strong> The author is an interesting personality. He is currently the host of daily (distancing) show at comedy central. I do watch his shows regularly. Ok, the book is an exciting read. It is a reflection of the author about his past. And interpretations of moments in his life, which at the time wasn't appeared significant but later shaped him. Trevor is a big name in comedy, and he does a lot to prove that. Must see some of Trevor's work and his interview - they are fascinating.

<strong>A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin:</strong> A long and complicated opening book for the series "A song of ice and fire". The story is known to every person; however, the book contains nearly 40% more content than the TV show. It also develops the character well, which to be honest is hard to replicate on TV. Still, the producers have done a great job nonetheless. All I could say is that George R.R. Martin is a master of world-building.

<strong>Sapiens - A Brief history of humankind by Yuval Noah Harari:</strong> The title is what the book is all about. It talks about the history of humankind from the stone age to modern age and how different factors such as science and religion affected its development. I didn't particularly enjoy it since I read it in fragmentation. But its an interesting read nonetheless and it's also a highly rated book. It has a broad audience for a science and history book which is impressive.

<strong>A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini:</strong> This was the first Hosseini's book that I read, and I wasn't quite ready for the emotional roller-coaster. If you read Hosseini you cry - there is no other way around it. It is based on Afghanistan during a time conflict between the Soviets and Taliban. Atrocities of war and the Taliban could be felt through the life of people of Afghanistan, especially women. Its a horrific depiction but also feels so real that you know in your heart the stories did happen somewhere in the same way (it felt Maryam was real). That's the beauty of this magnificent piece by Hosseini. The effect of this book is such that I am purposefully avoiding rereading it - I can't deal the emotions when I know how it feels.


This writing about the books will continue in future. It is like revisiting them.
